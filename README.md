# Libdspc

C/C++ Routines for One-dimension Discrete-time Signal Processing on commodity hardware, including online processing (mostly in the path_* named files for the latest).

Everything has been tested in the real world except for experimental/* which I discourage to use for now, as of version 1.1.1 of this lib.
